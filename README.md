# LexLuthor
Lexer in C language using DFA state machine (unlike the one used in gcc)

## How to compile and run C programs
```bash
$ gcc lexer.c
$ ./a.out
```

## Canabalizing the program
```bash
$ cp lexer.c sample.txt
$ ./a.out
```
The current `lexer.c` is a hardcoded one. Another one will be made shortly.
